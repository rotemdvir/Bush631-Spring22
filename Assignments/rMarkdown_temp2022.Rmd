This is an R Markdown document.  
In this space you can add any text you want.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

\vspace{2em}

```{r, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# Add R code here
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
x

y <- sum(x)
y
```

Add more text here.  
Use embedded R code to add a figure into your document:

\vspace{1em}
```{r, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width="85%"}

# Add R code for figures here
```
