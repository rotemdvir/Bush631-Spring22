# revolutionary leader: yes/no (coded 1/0)
table(rev_leaders = mydata$revolutionaryleader)

# pursue nuclear tech: yes/no (coded 1/0)
# If you want to see the number of NAs add exclude = NULL to the table function

# Creating treatment and control groups 
## Group by rebel experience (yes/no)
lead_rebels <- subset(mydata, subset = (rebel == 1))

## Groups by revolutionary leader
## Variable revolutionaryleader values: 0 = no; 1 = yes

### Confounders: Alliance with a superpower   ###

### Before and after design ###
## Before and after using the time indicator
## Create subsets for rebel leaders: 1st year in office; after year 1 in office
reb_one <- subset(lead_rebels, subset = (nonpuryrs == 0))

## Calculate difference-in-means for rebel leaders (year 1 versus other years)
