# Create data set of mean proportion of voting with US and Russia by year

### Correlation ###

### Q-Q plot
# Relationship b-w proportion of voting with US/USSR (explore the entire distribution)

### Matrices  ###
# Create a matrix: enter values, number of rows and columns
# byrow = TRUE -> data is inserted based on rows (type FALSE for insertion by columns)
m <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# Assign labels (names) to the rows and columns of the matrix
rownames(m) <- c("A","B","C","D")
colnames(m) <- c("W","X","Y","Z")
dim(m)

# Create data frame with 2 vectors
d <- data.frame(y1 = as.factor(c("X","Y","Z")), y2 = c(1,2,3))

# as.matrix() forces the data into a matrix form will change the values to character
m2 <- as.matrix(d)
m2

# Implement math operations on a matrix
rowSums(m)
colMeans(m)

# Implement apply functions on a matrix (1 is for rows, 2 for columns)
apply(m,1,mean)
apply(m,2,sd)

### Lists ###
x <- list(y1 = c("this","is","a list", "of", "Ukraine's", "neighbors"),
          y2 = 1:8,
          y3 = data.frame(num = 1:7, name = c("Russia","Belarus","Poland"
                                              ,"Slovakia", "Hungary", "Romania", "Moldova"),
                          direction = c("East","North","NW","West","West","SW","SW")))
# Extract objects from the list using the $ sign
x$y1
x$y3
x[["y3"]]

### K-means algorithm ###
# Using the k-means clustering to show groups of ideologies in 1989
# Create a subset of 1989 voting data
un89 <- subset(mydata, subset = (Year == 1989))

# Apply the k-means function, define the number of centers
cluster89 <- kmeans(un89[, c("idealpoint", "PctAgreeUS")], centers = 2) 
un89$cluster1 <- cluster89$cluster

# Plot the clusters
plot(x = un89$idealpoint, y = un89$PctAgreeUS, main = "1989",
     xlab = "Ideal point", ylab = "Percentage of Votes Agreeing with US",
     xlim = c(-3, 3), ylim = c(0, 1), pch = 16, col = un89$cluster1 + 1) 
points(cluster89$centers, pch = 8, cex = 2) # add centroids

# Using the k-means clustering to show groups of ideologies in 2012
# Create a subset of 2012 voting data
un12 <- subset(mydata, subset = (Year == 2012))

# Apply the k-means function, define the number of centers
cluster12 <- kmeans(un12[, c("idealpoint", "PctAgreeUS")], centers = 2) 
un12$cluster2 <- cluster12$cluster

# Plot the clusters
plot(x = un12$idealpoint, y = un12$PctAgreeUS, main = "2012",
     xlab = "Ideal point", ylab = "Percentage of Votes Agreeing with US",
     xlim = c(-3, 3), ylim = c(0, 1), pch = 16, col = un12$cluster2 + 1) 
points(cluster12$centers, pch = 8, cex = 2)

## Identify movers between ideology clusters

# First, merge the two clustering results
un8912 <- left_join(un89, un12, by = c("CountryAbb", "CountryName")) 

# tablulate how many countries in each cluster in either year (1989,2012)
table(cluster1989 = un8912$cluster1, cluster2012 = un8912$cluster2)

# Who shifted from liberal to non-liberal cluster 
un8912$CountryName[un8912$cluster1 > un8912$cluster2]

## Who shifted from non-liberal to liberal cluster
un8912$CountryName[un8912$cluster1 < un8912$cluster2]
